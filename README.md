# QGModel
This is Python code that solves the nonlinear QG equations for PV anomalies on a doubly-periodic domain.  It consists of a fully-dealiased pseudo-spectral code for stepping forward the PV conservation equations and implementations of specific model types.  These implement the inversion relation specific to the model, e.g. the Eady model.
